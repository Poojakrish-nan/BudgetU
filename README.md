### Overview:

BudgetU is a budget management application designed to help students track and control their expenses effectively. By leveraging OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology, the system enables users to scan their bills, extract relevant expenditure details, and categorize expenses automatically. The application provides real-time visual insights using a dual-bar graph that compares expected versus actual spending, ensuring students maintain financial discipline throughout the month. It also has a subscription tracker that enables one to track their online subscriptions along with the next renewal date. There is also a feature that sends an alert when the user reach close to 75% of their allotted¬†expense.

### The Problem statement

Many students struggle with managing their monthly expenses effectively, often exceeding their budgets due to a lack of real-time tracking and financial awareness. Traditional budgeting methods require manual entry and oversight, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. There is a need for an automated, user-friendly solution that helps students categorize and monitor their expenses dynamically, ensuring they stay within their financial limits and develop better spending habits.
This problem led to the development of BudgetU, a system that automates expense tracking through bill scanning, categorization, and real-time budget comparison, helping students maintain financial discipline effortlessly


### The Solution
BudgetU is an intelligent budgeting application designed to help students manage their monthly expenses efficiently. By leveraging OCR technology, the system allows users to scan their bills, automatically extract expense details, and categorize them based on predefined budget categories. A real-time dual-bar graph visually compares expected versus actual expenditures, enabling students to track their spending patterns effortlessly. With automated updates, alerts for budget overruns, and insightful analytics, BudgetU empowers students to make informed financial decisions and develop better spending habits.
